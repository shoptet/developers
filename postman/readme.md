# Postman collection for Shoptet API

This postman collection is **deprecated**. We recommend using the [Shoptet Public API Workspace](https://www.postman.com/shoptet-developers/shoptet-public-api-workspace) instead.
see readme.md in the root of this repository for more details.

If you use Postman as an API platform for building and using APIs, we provide you a complex collection of Shoptet API.
